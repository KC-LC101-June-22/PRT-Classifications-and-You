 PRT Classifications and You
  <p>Recent years have seen a sharp increase in the number of people displaying superpowers. These individuals formally known as Parahumans and colloquially as “capes” have brought with them disruptions to the stability of society. That is where you come in, as a new recruit of your local Parahuman Response Team or PRT it is you job to manage these parahumans and protect your fellow citizens. One of the many challenges of being a member of the PRT is quickly and accurately assessing a situation involving a parahuman as the range and diversity of their abilities is vast. The following classification system has been created to assist your in this task. From most low to high priority the 12 classifications are Brute, Striker, Blaster, Mover, Changer, Breaker, Shaker, Trump, Stranger, Tinker, Master, Thinker. These classifications are then given a number typically 1-10 to indicate their strength or difficulty in confronting.</p>

      <h1>Brute:</h1>
    </header>
    <p>The Brute classification covers powers that enhanced a parahuman’s strength and/or durability. Brutes do not necessarily have both super strength and super durability but only rarely is a Brute not durable enough to weather their power. An example of a high strength low durability Brute would be a very low range telekinesis allowing for the lifting of objects but no defensive benefits while a low strength high durability Brute could be modeled as a personal force field, protecting the user but leaving them with standard human strength. Brutes are normally a low priority target. While dangerous the threat they present can be managed by confining or hampering their movement.

      <h1>
      Striker:
      </h1>
    </header>
      <p>
        Striker powers are those that are applied via touch or are effective within a short, “melee” range such as any effect that mimic claws, swords, or spikes. Classic examples of Striker powers are shocking grasps, energy weapons, or mutational powers but are not limited to damaging effects as in the case of powers that slow or freeze a target. High level Brutes, while typically capable of powerful punches, are not considered Strikers unless their punches are exceptionally destructive or have some other effect active. Striker capes are best handled at long range where their powers cannot reach and as such are general noted as low priority targets.
      </p>
    <header>
      <h1>
      Blaster:
      </h1>
    </header>
      <p>
        The Blaster classification covers powers that produce a ranged effect. Typical examples include lasers, jets of flame, physical projectiles, etc. Blaster powers will differ in distance, accuracy, and area though very short ranges are better classified under striker and very large areas as shakers. Effects of Blaster powers are not necessarily damaging, examples of non damaging blasts would be those that freeze or slow their targets. In practical applications, Blaster powers can be treated similarly to conventional firearms with many of the standard procedures applying to both; using cover to block line of sight, closing the distance when possible, and suppression with friendly ordinance are all effective strategies against Blaster capes. Blaster capes are a low to medium priority depending on their rating and exact effect of their blast.

    <header>
      <h1>
      Mover:
      </h1>
    </header>
      <p>
        The Mover classification covers powers that increase the speed and mobility of the parahuman. Examples of Mover powers include superspeed, teleportation, enhanced agility and acrobatics, etc. The most effective means of combating Mover capes is to limit their mobility typical via the terrain. Choosing dense, enclosed areas to deal with them can be effective. Mover capes receive low to medium priority ratings as their speed lets them apply pressure over an area in a fight and they can transport equipment and teammates to more advantageous positions in a fight.
      </p>
    <header>
      <h1>
      Changer:
      </h1>
    </header>
      <p>
        Changer powers are those that alter and change a parahuman’s body including growing natural weapons and armor, adaptations to different environments, and self healing. The most dangerous aspect of a Changer cape is their adaptability as they can take on aspects of other classifications based on their changes. Focusing fire on a Changer cape can overwhelm any self healing and remove them from a conflict when higher priority targets are not present, as such they tend towards a lower priority. 
      </p>
    <header>
      <h1>
      Breaker:
      </h1>
    </header>
      <p>
        Similarly to Changer powers, Parahumans with a Breaker classification have an alternate form but these powers manifest as a binary (or set number) of states as compared to the Changers more fluid changes. Breaker powers are also typified by effects that circumvent or break known laws of physics. Examples of Breaker powers include forms mimicking “elements” such as fire/electricity/water as well as forms that grant invulnerability or intangibility. Breaker capes are most easily handled in their non-Breaker states where they are effectively normal people making surprise attacks effective. The nature of most Breaker states make them difficult to deal with but being in such a state will normally have increasing detriments to the Parahuman making drawn out fights an option in some instances. A medium priority is given to Breaker capes due to the physics defying aspects of their powers and, like changers, their powers can have traits of other classifications, i.e. an electrical form having striker or blaster applications.
      </p>
    <header>
      <h1>
        Shaker:
      </h1>
    </header>
      <p>
      Shaker powers are those that effect a wide area such as the namesake earthquake generation or others like gas, auras, or terrain manipulation. The key aspect of a Shaker power is their ability to control a battlefield or an area of one. Because of this handling a Shaker cape is difficult as there is typically no terrain advantage or area control possible when dealing with one. Depending on the exact nature of the Shaker effect, splitting up may reduce the impact to a response team by limiting the number of agents affect by the Shaker power. When possible engaging a Shaker cape from outside their area of effect is the best option. Shakers receive medium to high priority ratings, especially as their powers can easily impact bystanders.
      </p>
    <header>
      <h1>
        Trump:
      </h1>
    </header>
      <p>
        The Trump classification covers any power that interacts and affects other parahuman’s powers including power nullification, copying, draining, strengthening etc. Trump capes by nature are more powerful the more parahumans are involved in a conflict making the most effective means of dealing with them is to isolate and contain them. In many situations it is a benefit to have no powers when dealing with Trump capes. The reason then that they get medium to high priority’s is that their impact in a fight increases for every additional power involved so that removing them early is the best option. A controlled fight may be disrupted if a new parahuman joins in giving the Trump cape more power or more options.
      </p>
    <header>
      <h1>
      Stranger:
      </h1>
    </header>
      <p>
        Stranger powers give a Parahuman enhanced stealth and infiltration abilities. Common examples include invisibility, disguising oneself, and effects that inhibit the senses of others such as blinding smoke or cancelling noise. Strangers can be very difficult to deal with as many can infiltrate PRT squads and give false commands. The PRT has developed what is known as Master/Stranger protocols to handle situations where the chain of command is potentially infected with other agents. In a situation involving Stranger capes it is of critical importance that PRT agents follow the established protocols and carefully observe themselves and their teammates for any deviations. The full detailing of these protocols can be found in it’s own dedicated presentation. It is of no surprise that Stranger powers are given high priorities as even off of the battle field these powers can seriously hamper PRT efforts.
      </p>
    <header>
      <h1>
      Tinker
      </h1>
    </header>
      <p>
        Tinkers are defined by their advanced technology, the knowledge and ability to create such technology is their power. Commonly, Tinker capes work within a specific field or type of technology such as vehicles, cryogenics, and even steam or plant based devices. With rare exceptions Tinker technology requires maintenance that is only performable by the creator making widespread use of their devices impractical. When confronting a Tinker it is best to target their devices as once destroyed the Tinker is relatively harmless. Denying Tinkers the materials and time to fabricate their items is another effective way to manage their power. Tinkers are given a high priority despite their dependance on time and materials because of their adaptability. Even within a certain field, Tinkers are quite capable of observing and countering threats and obstacles with their devices. If left alone, Tinkers are often able to turn the tides of a conflict by building the exact counter that they need.
      </p>
    <header>
      <h1>
      Master:
      </h1>
    </header>
      <p>
        The Master classification is for Parahumans that use minions to do their fighting whether through summoning, creating, or controlling them. The number and strength of the minions vary between Master capes with the general rule of fewer but stronger minions or more but weaker minions. Separating a Master cape from their minions is the most effective means of combating them. Do to the threat that some Master powers dominate and control people the PRT has create a set of Master/Stranger protocols to handle these situations. The protocols outline the steps to take if civilians or other PRT agents fall under the sway of a Master cape and any protocols necessary to ensure that the chain of command is not compromised by controlled individuals. Masters receive a high priority due to their threat to civilians and the function of the PRT both on and off the battlefield.
      </p>
    <header>
      <h1>
        Thinker:
      </h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      The last PRT classification is Thinker which covers Parahumans which have powers involving gathering and receiving information. This classification includes clairvoyance, precognition, enhanced senses (including non-standard senses), and more. Where possible, disrupting a Thinkers ability to gather information is the best means of confronting them. Sight based thinkers can be disrupted via flash bangs or keeping critical areas in the dark, random numbers may be effective against some precogs, etc. Isolating Thinkers from their allies is the next best step. Often their ability to obtain critical information or strategically command their allies is the key to their battle plan and by removing them and/or their ability to communicate their effect on a battle can be diminished. Thinkers receive the highest priority as their abilities work as force multipliers for any team they are on. Thinker capes tend towards being physically weaker than other classifications making their capture a less resource intensive endeavor. Outside of a battle, Thinkers can threaten critical social systems such as the stock market or internet. It is for this reason that the PRT has the Watchdog division. The Watchdog division is comprised of PRT aligned Thinkers that monitor the internet and other areas for outside influence. More information is available in the Watchdog specific presentation.

      <h1>
        Number Rating:
      </h1>
    </header>
    <p1>As mentioned each Parahuman is given a number value for their classification(s) that give an indicator for how strong their power is. These number are typically in the range of 1-10 though values lower* and higher** are viable. Response protocols for each classification change with the number rating and more detailed descriptions can be found in other presentations. The general threat levels are as follows:
    </p1>
    <ol>
      <li>The typical civilian would be able to deal with this power.</li>
      <li>A trained and equipped individual would be able to deal with this power.</li>
      <li>Multiple trained individuals are needed to handle this power.</li>
      <li>A full PRT response team is needed to handle this power though other factors, such as weather or environment, may impact the success rate.</li>
      <li>Another Parahuman is needed to address the threat. A PRT response team can engage and stall.</li>
      <li>A trained Parahuman with a PRT Response team are able to handle this power. A PRT team without powered backup such postpone engagement and gather intel if possible.</li>
      <li>Assisting Parahumans should engage in pairs of 2 or 3. PRT response team should focus on assisting and gathering intel.</li>
      <li>Civilian evacuation is the first priority of the PRT response team. Parahuman teams should engage only when fully prepared.</li>
      <li>Standard tactics are not effective. PRT and Parahuman teams should focus on evacuation. Engage once mission objectives and strategies are fully in place.</li>
      <li>Additional Parahuman teams and/or specific high powered individuals should be called in. Civilian evacuation up to city level may be needed. PRT response teams should focus on evacuation efforts.</li>      
    </ol>
    <footer>
      <p1>
        *A 0 rating would indicate a standard human level of ability and a negative value would indicate a hampered ability such as a Breaker state that slows a cape below walking speed.
        <br></br>
**10+ values indicate severe danger threatening entire cities or countries. 15 is given to powers capable of destroying the planet or causing a human extinction event

        Power Complexity

    </header>
    <p1>
      Parahuman abilities are unique and diverse; rarely does one classification fully cover the capabilities of an individual. Multiple classifications are written with a / such as a Brute/Mover or Shaker/Thinker. Each classification receives its own rating and all ratings should be taken into account when determining the threat level of a Parahuman. By convention the powers decrease in effect or importance from left to right. A Brute/Mover could be a power that makes a cape more durable while moving and enhanced leg strength to run faster. The Shaker/Thinker example could be a power that causes tectonic events with a Thinker power that gives and intuitive knowledge of structural weak points. 
    </p1>
    <p2>
Powers can also have sub classifications indicated by () such as Changer(Brute) or Blaster(Mover). These subclassifications indicate a usage of the main classification that can mimic or produce the effect of the subclassification. In our example the Changer power may specialize in forming scales or other defensive changes to give the Brute subclassification and a Blaster power may be able to self-propel a cape to give a Mover subclassification. 
    </p2>
  <p3>
It is important to remember that powers can be very complex or not well understood (by the PRT or the Parahuman) and so the classification system is not a perfect representation of the capabilities of a Parahuman. Following the appropriate protocols is the best means of protecting yourself and those around you but is no substitute for observing and adapting to a situation. After contact with Parahumans it is important to accurately fill out the post mission forms to maintain an accurate Parahuman database. The PRT thanks you for your service.
